VEHICLE_DETECTION AND COUNTING

This is a simple vehile detection project using OpenCV

Here I used background subtractions methods of OpenCV Library of Python and morphological transformation.
Here we defined a vehicle class  named as Vehicle.py

Library Required:
1.opencv
2. Numpy

For running it, just download all files and run the Vehicle_detection_main.py
Thank you.
